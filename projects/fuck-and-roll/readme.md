Use json, json5, toml, or whatever, and say `fuck-github-action`!

## Want to fuck?

```shell
cargo install fuck-github-action --force
```

## Git auto fuck!

To prevent forgetting to fuck, you can use git hook to help you fuck github action.

you can create a `.git/hooks/pre-commit`, then edit manually or use the command line:

```shell
echo '#!/bin/sh' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
echo 'fuck-github-action' >> .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
